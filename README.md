### Installations and Requirments

This project requires no additional installations.

### Project Motivation

A python package that calculates probabilities of outcomes from a collection of weighted coins.


### File Descriptions

- Coins_Load_Data.py: a class that initializes a coin collection.
- Coins.py: a class that inherits the default coin collection from Coins_Load_Data, replaces
the collection with user defined coins, and then calculates the liklihood of various outcomes.
- init.py: initializes the Bayes_Coins class.
- test.py: unit tests to test if the classes are working as expected.

### How to Interact with this project

The primary scripts are the Generaldistribution.py, Gaussiandistribution.py and
Binomialdistribution.py. 

To Import this package in python use: <pre><code>pip install sauce_probability
</code></pre>

You can find this package on pypi at https://pypi.org/project/sauce-probability/0.1/

The sample text files can be used as sample data for the gaussian and binomial classes.

numbers.txt can be used for the Gaussian class, and numbers_binomial.txt for the binomial class.
